## 📖 **Project Details**
<details>
<summary><strong>📜 Project Background</strong> (Click to expand) 🔍</summary>

This demo was created using simple prompts along with reference images from **pxdx.studio**.  

Through **less than 10 conversation rounds** with **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, I was able to create this design.  
📌 **Key milestones:**  
- The **basic implementation** was achieved in just **3 rounds**, which was incredibly efficient.  
- The **interactive animations** were implemented in about **2 rounds**.  
- The remaining time was spent on **fine-tuning** details like **fonts, copy text, and color adjustments**.  

While this is **just a demo** with **several limitations** that might prevent it from being used in any actual project,  
for someone like me with **no prior AI frontend programming experience**,  
📌 **building such an impressive webpage in under 10 minutes** was an **incomparable delight**. 🎉

<summary><strong>🧠 AI Prompts Used</strong> (Click to expand) 💬</summary>

💻 **Prompt 1**:  
> `"Completely analyze this interface's functionality and interaction logic, then implement a similar interface with interactive features and a simple data backend, with a frosted glass design style."`

🎨 **Prompt 2**:  
> `"Can you mimic this part of the design style as much as possible? You can first analyze its layout and design style."`

These minimal prompts, combined with reference images, were enough to **generate functional code** with high accuracy! 🔥
