<summary><strong>Project Background</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

This demo was created using simple prompts along with reference images from pxdx.studio. Through less than 10 conversation rounds with Claude 3.7 Sonnet (in fact, the basic implementation was achieved in just 3 rounds, which was incredibly efficient), I was able to create this design. The interactive animations were implemented in about 2 rounds, with the remaining time spent on fine-tuning details like fonts, copy text, and color adjustments.

While this is just a demo with several limitations that might prevent it from being used in any actual project, for someone like me with no prior AI frontend programming experience, building such an impressive webpage in under 10 minutes was an incomparable delight.

<summary><strong>AI Prompts I Used</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

> 1. "Completely analyze this interface's functionality and interaction logic, then implement a similar interface with interactive features and a simple data backend, with a frosted glass design style."

> 2. "Can you mimic this part of the design style as much as possible? You can first analyze its layout and design style."

These simple prompts, combined with reference images, were all that was needed to generate the functional code.

I am a paid user of Poe and have no commercial partnership, affiliation, or financial relationship with Anthropic (creators of Claude) or Poe.

<summary><strong>External Resources Disclaimer</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

This demo includes references to external resources through its Content Security Policy (CSP). The original code was generated using Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the Poe platform, which automatically adds these CSP permissions to allow various external libraries and resources to function if needed.

### Important Notes:

1. **Background Image**: The demo uses a background image from Unsplash (`https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522771739844-6a9f6d5f14af`). This is the only external resource actively loaded in the implementation.

2. **Content Security Policy**: The HTML code contains a comprehensive CSP that includes permissions for various external resources like Bootstrap (via maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com), jQuery, and other libraries. This CSP was automatically generated by the Poe platform and does not necessarily reflect which resources are actually being loaded by the page.

3. **Actual Resource Usage**: While the CSP permits access to many external resources, the page itself may not actually load all these resources. You would need to examine the specific `<script>` and `<link>` tags in the HTML to determine which external resources are actually being used.

4. **Unicode Icons**: Some Unicode characters are used as icons (such as ðŸ”‘), which are part of standard character sets and don't require external resources.

5. **No Data Collection**: This demo does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. The login functionality is simulated and no actual authentication occurs.
